![DCCW Dataset teaser](image/dccw-teaser.jpg)  

We evaluate DCCW using three different datasets for each purpose.

| Name | Purpose | 
|------|---------|
| [FM100P](FM100P/README.md) | Evaluation of the single palette sorting |
| [KHTP](KHTP/README.md) | Evaluation of the palette pair sorting |
| [LHSP](LHSP/README.md) | Evaluation of the palette similarity measurement |
