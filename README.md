## Abstract

We evaluate [DCCW](https://github.com/SuziKim/DCCW) using three different datasets for each purpose.

| Name | Purpose | 
|------|---------|
| [FM100P](FM100P/README.md) | Evaluation of the single palette sorting |
| [KHTP](KHTP/README.md) | Evaluation of the palette pair sorting |
| [LHSP](LHSP/README.md) | Evaluation of the palette similarity measurement |
| [Perceptual Study](perceptual-study/README.md) | Perceptual Study |
